# SortingAlgorithmsInCPP

## Overview
This program was created for a university project and acts to showcase some of the major methods of number sorting. Once the program is started, the demonstration will run instantly. The following represent the general steps of the program:

1. Generate an array with eight random numbers between one and ten.
2. Sort using the quick sort method.
3. Sort using the bubble sort method.
4. Sort using the insertion sort method.
5. Sort using the merge sort method.
6. Display results.

## Measuring the Efficiency of Algorithms
One of the requirements of this project was to quantify the number of steps each sorting algorithm needs to completely sort the array. When the data is displayed to the user, both the sorted array and number of steps are output to:

1. Verify that the algorithm sorted the array successfully.
2. Determine how many steps were made to complete the sorting process.

By tracking this data, the program demonstrates the efficiency of each method. As an example, I have found that the insertion sort algorithm tends to require the least amount of steps, while the quick sort algorithm requires the most.
